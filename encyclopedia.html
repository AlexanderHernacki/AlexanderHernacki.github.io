<h1>Variable valve timing</h1>
</header>
<p>In <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine">internal combustion engines</a>, <strong>variable valve timing (VVT)</strong> is the process of altering the timing of a valve lift event, and is often used to improve performance, fuel economy or emissions. It is increasingly being used in combination with variable valve lift systems. There are many ways in which this can be achieved, ranging from mechanical devices to electro-hydraulic and camless systems. Increasingly strict emissions regulations are causing many automotive manufacturers to use VVT systems. </p>

    <h3>Continuous versus discrete</h3>
    <p>Early variable valve timing systems used discrete (stepped) adjustment. For example, one timing would be used below 3500 rpm and another used above 3500 rpm.</p>
    <p>More advanced "continuous variable valve timing" systems offer continuous (infinite) adjustment of the valve timing. Therefore, the timing can be optimized to suit all engine speeds and conditions.</p>

    <section id="Cam phasing versus variable duration">
    <h3>Cam phasing versus variable duration</h3>
    <p>The simplest form of VVT is <em>cam-phasing</em>, whereby the phase angle of the <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camshaft">camshaft</a> is rotated forwards or backwards relative to the crankshaft. Thus the valves open and close earlier or later; however, the camshaft lift and duration cannot be altered solely with a cam-phasing system.</p>
    <p>Achieving variable duration on a VVT system requires a complex system, such as multiple cam profiles or oscillating cams. </p>

    <h3>Steam engines</h3>
    <p>The history of the search for a method of variable valve opening duration goes back to the age of <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine">steam engines</a> when the valve opening duration was referred to as "steam <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_(steam_engine)">cut-off</a>”. The <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephenson_valve_gear">Stephenson valve gear</a>, as used on early steam locomotives, supported variable cutoff, that is, changes to the time at which the admission of steam to the cylinders is cut off during the power stroke. </p>
    <p>Early approaches to variable cutoff coupled variations in admission cutoff with variations in exhaust cutoff. Admission and exhaust cutoff were decoupled with the development of the <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corliss_valve">Corliss valve</a>. These were widely used in constant speed variable load stationary engines, with admission cutoff, and therefore torque, mechanically controlled by a <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor">centrifugal governor</a> and <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_valve">trip valves</a>. </p>
    <p>As <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppet_valve">poppet valves</a> came into use, a simplified valve gear using a <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camshaft">camshaft</a> came into use. With such engines, variable cutoff could be achieved with variable profile cams that were shifted along the camshaft by the governor. The <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Serpollet">Serpollet</a> steamcars produced very hot high pressure steam, requiring poppet valves, and these used a patented sliding camshaft mechanism, which not only varied the inlet valve cut-off but allowed the engine to be reversed.</p>

    <h3>Aircraft</h3>
    <p>An early experimental 200 hp <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerget">Clerget</a> V-8 from the 1910s used a sliding camshaft to change the valve timing. Some versions of the Bristol Jupiter <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_engine">radial engine</a> of the early 1920s incorporated variable valve timing gear, mainly to vary the inlet valve timing in connection with higher compression ratios.[6] The <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycoming_R-7755">Lycoming R-7755</a> engine had a Variable Valve Timing system consisting of two cams that can be selected by the pilot. One for take off, pursuit and escape, the other for economical cruising.</p>

    <h3>Automotive</h3>
    <p>The desirability of being able to vary the valve opening duration to match an engine's rotational speed first became apparent in the 1920s when maximum allowable RPM limits were generally starting to rise. Until about this time an engine's idle RPM and its operating RPM were very similar, meaning that there was little need for variable valve duration. The first use of variable valve timing was on the 1903 Cadillac Runabout and Tonneau created by Alanson Partridge Brush Patent 767,794 “INLET VALVE GEAR FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES” filed August 3rd, 1903, and granted August 16th, 1904. Some time prior to 1919 Lawrence Pomeroy, Vauxhall's Chief Designer, had designed a 4.4 L engine for a proposed replacement for the existing 30-98 model to be called the H-Type.[8] In this engine the single overhead camshaft was to move longitudinally to allow different camshaft lobes to be engaged. It was in the 1920s that the first patents for variable duration valve opening started appearing for example United States patent <a HREF="https://patents.google.com/patent/US1527456">U.S. Patent 1,527,456</a>. </p>
    <p><a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo">Alfa Romeo</a> was the first manufacturer to use a variable valve timing system in production cars (US Patent 4,231,330). The fuel injected models of the 1980 <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_Spider">Alfa Romeo Spider</a> 2000 had a mechanical VVT system. The system was engineered by Ing Giampaolo Garcea in the 1970s. All Alfa Romeo Spider models from 1983 onward used electronic VVT.</p>

        <p>Variable valve timing has been applied to motorcycle engines but was considered a non-useful "technological showpiece" as late as 2004 due to the system's weight penalty. Since then, motorcycles including VVT have included the <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_1400GTR">Kawasaki 1400GTR/Concours 14</a> (2007), <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_Multistrada_1200">the Ducati Multistrada 1200</a> (2015), the <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_R1250GS">BMW R1250GS</a> (2019) and the <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YZF-R15">Yamaha YZF-R15 V3.0</a> (2017), the Suzuki GSX-R1000R 2017 L7.</p>

    <p>Variable valve timing has begun to trickle down to marine engines. <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Penta">Volvo Penta<a>'s VVT marine engine uses a cam phaser, controlled by the ECM, continuously varies advance or retardation of camshaft timing.</p>

    <p>In 2007, Caterpillar developed the C13 and C15 Acert engines which used VVT technology to reduce NOx emissions, to avoid the use of EGR after 2002 EPA requirements.</p>
    <p>In 2010, <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Motors">Mitsubishi</a> developed and started mass production of its 4N13 1.8 L DOHC I4, the world's first passenger car <a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine">diesel engine</a> that features a variable valve timing system.</p>
